"""
Patch some core words for performance, now that we have a
standard library. Note that this only could be done to words
that *entirely* consist of builtins (at least at here-time).

> Optimization in Novika is mostly about reducing the word count,
> reducing word lookup and block climbing, and using more builtins.
