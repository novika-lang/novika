# This is your library's manifest. Here you can list capabilities,
# files to run, etc. Order will be respected. You can also use '*'
# which stands for "not otherwise mentioned Novika scripts in this
# directory" and '**' which stands for "not otherwise mentioned
# subdirectories that are not apps nor libs, as well as Novika scripts".
#
# Here is an example manifest:
#
# start.nk begin.nk * done.nk ** exit.nk
