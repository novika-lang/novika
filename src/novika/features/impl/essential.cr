       unsafe hydration (hydrates without making an instance
       of the block). For a safer alternative, see `hydrate`.
       Use if you know what you're doing, or if you're ready
       to make an instance yourself.

      Details: `hydrate!` is considered unsafe because hydration
      artifacts are exposed to the user and/or its blocks. The
      contents of a block after hydration may differ from its
      contents before unsafe hydration. Indeed, `hydrate!` is
      almost as unsafe as pushing into `conts`; the only benefit
      it provides is that it is able to catch infinite/very
      deep recursion.
