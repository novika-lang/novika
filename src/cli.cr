      novika - command-line frontend for Novika #{VERSION}

      Syntax:

        novika [switches] [runnables]

      Switches:

        -h, --help, h, help, ?  prints this message
        -p[:PERIOD]             enables profiling, samples every PERIOD ticks (default: 16)

      Runnables:

        #{"file".colorize.bold}

          When runnable is a file, that file is read and run.

          Examples:

            $ novika hello.nk
            $ novika a.nk b.nk c.nk
            # Note: order matters. That is, a.nk <- b.nk <- c.nk,
            # where '<-' means "is executed before & visible to"

        #{"library directory".colorize.bold}

          Any directory is implicitly a library directory. A directory may be
          explicitly marked as a library directory by putting a .nk.lib manifest
          file inside it.

          When runnable is a library directory, *.nk files in it are run. First,
          <directory-name>.nk file is run (if it exists), then, all other files are
          run. Lastly, this process is repeated on sub-directories (if any).

          Examples:

            $ mkdir foo
            $ echo "'Hi from lib core!' echo" > foo/foo.nk
            $ echo "'Salutations from lib slave!' echo" > foo/slave.nk
            $ novika foo
            Hi from lib core!
            Salutations from lib slave!

        #{"application directory".colorize.bold}

          Mostly similar to library directories. Marked by .nk.app manifest file
          inside the directory. Note that:

          * For appplication directories, <directory-name>.nk file is run last
            rather than first.

          * You cannot provide more than one application directory.

          Examples:

            $ mkdir bar
            $ touch bar/.nk.app
            $ echo "'Hi from app core!' echo" > bar/bar.nk
            $ echo "'Salutations from app slave!' echo" > bar/slave.nk
            $ novika bar
            Salutations from app slave!
            Hi from app core!

        #{"capability id".colorize.bold}

          When runnable is a capability id, the corresponding capability is enabled
          to all other files and capabilities run (that is, everyone is allowed to
          use it).

          A runnable might ask you for permission to enable a capability or two
          (for example, disk and/or ffi). Your choice to allow is remembered;
          your choice to deny isn't.

          Here is a list of available capabilities:

      END

      available_caps = CapabilityCollection.available

      available_caps.select(&.on_by_default?).each do |cap|
        io.puts
        io << "      - " << on << " " << cap.id << " (" << cap.purpose << ")"
      end

      available_caps.reject(&.on_by_default?).each do |cap|
        io.puts
        io << "      - " << cap.id << " (" << cap.purpose << ")"
      end

      io.puts

      io << <<-END

      Autoloading:

        Novika autoloads (implicitly loads) the directory named 'core' in the
        current working directory, and the directory named 'core' in '~/.novika'
        (assuming they exist at their respective locations.)

      Home directory:

        Novika home directory, '~/.novika', is where globally accessible runnables
        are found. When a runnable cannot be found in the current working directory,
        '~/.novika' is searched.

      Examples:

        Run the Novika REPL:
          $ novika repl

        Run the REPL, but preload a file first:
          $ novika foo.nk repl

        Create a Novika app (you must be inside an empty directory)
          $ novika new

        Run the snake example:
          $ novika console examples/snake.new.nk

      Something doesn't seem to work right?
